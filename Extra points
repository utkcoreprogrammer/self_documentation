* AOT : In angular 6 application, Ahead Of Time compilation takes place. It compiles the application a during the build, ahead of the runtime whereas JIT compilation compiles the application during in the browser at runtime. This produces faster/better UX.

JIT generates JavaScript however, AoT usually generates TypeScript.

* Source maps : Source maps helps us debug our applications, even if the files are compressed & combined. It is generated behind the scenes, by default, on development build, but not on production build.

* Snake Case : Words are written in either uppercase or lowercase but are seperated with an underscore.
Eg : foo_bar, Hello_World, Hello_india etc.

* Kebab Case : Words are seperated with a dash rest similar to snake case. Eg : foo-Bar, Hello-World, Hello-india etc.

* Train case : If every word is capitalized, rest same as kebab case. Eg : FOO-BAR

* Pascal Case : Pascal case is a subset of Camel Case where the first letter is capitalized. Eg : HelloWorld

* Gulp : A task runner to automate few processes like - Converting TS to JS, manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files, minifying uglyfying etc. These are basically build tasks!

* Lazy loading : It is done to load few expensive resources on-demand. When we hit an angular application, it loads all its resources which results in reduced startup time of an application. Lazy loading is applied on few angular modules seperately.  

* Inside Lib folder in backend : We define and put third party API's which we need to use at many places in our application.

* Inside config : We set environment variables (URL which will hit when the application will run such as localhost etc.) for different modes of our project. For development mode, production mode etc. 

* SCSS  : Sashy CSS. In this we declare certain certain css properties using $ symbol . Eg : $width , $color and can use it again and again by changing its value. 

* SASS : Syntactically Awesome style sheets : an older approach of writing css, where there is no semicolon and curly braces between the css properties. It works on indentation, line breaks and white spaces!

* Angular Live Reload not working  : Run these two commands back 2 back
				     sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
				     sudo sysctl -p --system

* Using Array Map Function : $scope.item = $scope.groupMembers.map(({fname}) => fname)
